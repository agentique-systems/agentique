# Stages

The single progress record for the realignment (REALIGNMENT §5, §7.3). One
short section per stage: what was done, what was measured, what failed, what
is deferred, and what the Operator should try. A stage is complete only when
the Operator has used its outcome and accepts it (C-15).

Status values: **not started**, **in progress**, **provisionally complete,
pending Operator acceptance**, **accepted**.

## Before Stage 0: preserve the past

Status: done.

- Merged `platform/native-studio-alpha-acceptance` into `main` as is, with the
  previously untracked `verification/native-studio-acceptance/` records
  (PR #21, merge commit). Its old CI is red by design.
- Annotated tag `archive/pre-realignment` on `main` (C-22). Every retired file
  is recoverable from it.
- Full backup bundle outside the repository:
  `../agentique-pre-realignment.bundle`, checked with `git bundle verify`.
- Deleted the 22 local branches already merged into `main`. Pruned 61 worktree
  records whose folders no longer existed. Unmerged branches, the remaining
  worktrees and remote branches are left for the Operator.

## Stage 0: archive and clean

Status: in progress.

## Stage 1: fast, honest language core

Status: not started.

## Stage 2: Studio foundation

Status: not started.

## Stage 3: the Assistant

Status: not started.
